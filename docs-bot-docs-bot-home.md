<p>Welcome to the Root Bot developer guide. This guide shows you how to build Bots that run server-side in a community, without a user interface. Bots can listen to messages, respond to events, manage users, and automate tasks, all through code. You'll learn how to set up your Bot, connect it to a community, and make it do useful work.</p>
